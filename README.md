TomatoTracker is a cross-platform desktop timer, inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. This technique can be used for increased productivity. The general idea is that one time-boxes (see also [Timeboxing on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)) a certain activity of fixed length (typically 20-25mins, but can also be 40-60mins) and then purposefully takes a short break of a certain length. After that break, one starts to work again for a certain amount of time until the work interval is over.
After 4-6 work intervals (and 4-6 short break intervals), one then takes a longer break, after which one can start over.

This is a project I have worked on in summer 2016. After returning to university, I felt that I would want to focus more on my studies - or to continue working on other projects.

For me, this project served the purpose of learning JavaFX (and the JavaFX dependency injection framework afterburner.fx), as well as the basics of Maven and the Java Preferences API, which I use for storing the user-set preferences when running the application again. Moreover, I could try out some unit testing.

Feel free to fork, create issues and contribute!

## Features
* Starting, stopping and pausing the timer
* Changing the actual time used for work/short break intervals
* Hotkeys for stopping/pausing/skipping breaks/adding time to breaks
